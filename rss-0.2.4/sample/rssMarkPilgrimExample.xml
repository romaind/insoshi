The spec is barely a week old and already I'm seeing pingbacks on sites of people I've never heard of, so implementations are spreading, which is great. It also seems pingback has acted a little like a kick in the backside to the trackback folk, causing them to work on the transparency side of trackback, which is good to see too.</q></p>]]></content:encoded>

This is useful for developers who want to consume RSS 2.0 feeds and want to know how to handle the new namespace-based elements.  Already support <code>language</code>?  Be on the lookout for <code>dc:language</code> as well.  And so forth.  The mapping isn't always that direct (some elements use different formats, like <code>pubDate</code> and <code>dc:date</code>), but it's a good start to an important discussion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>RSS 2.0 template</title>
      <link>http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/26.html#rss_20_template</link>
      <description>RSS 2.0 template for Movable Type, ready to copy and paste over your existing RSS 0.91 template (index.xml).  There are several design decisions at work in this tempate that bear explaining.</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">1844@http://diveintomark.org/</guid>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/public/rss2.tmpl">RSS 2.0 template for Movable Type</a>, ready to copy and paste over your existing RSS 0.91 template (<code>index.xml</code>).  No modifications are required, unless your weblog is in a language other than English, in which case you'll need to change the <code>dc:language</code> tag to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn.html">your language code</a>.  (Use the 2-letter language code, unless there isn't one for your language, in which case, use the 3-letter language code.  And while you're at it, put the same language code <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_7_identifying_your_language.html">in your <code>HTML</code> tag</a> in your normal page templates.  But I digress.)</p>

<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/xml/rss2.xml">Here's what the RSS 2.0 output looks like</a>.</p>

<p>There are several design decisions at work in this template that bear explaining.  First of all, this template is designed to be backward-compatible with all existing aggregators, news readers, and RSS parsers, ranging from the super-smart XML parser built into .NET to the dumb, minimal, regular-expression-based parser that your downstairs neighbor banged out on a Friday night.  If you upgrade your existing <code>index.xml</code> right now, none of these parsers should crash, and none of your subscribers should scream bloody murder.  This is a good thing.</p>

<p>Now then, if you look at the template, you'll notice a whole slew of lines at the top like <code>xmlns:dc="..."</code>.  These are namespaces.  Keven Hemenway has written an excellent primer on <a href="http://www.disobey.com/detergent/2002/extendingrss2/">extending RSS 2.0 with namespaces</a>, so I won't explain them here except to say that we use them, and you should get used to seeing them.  Most RSS 2.0 documents you see will use namespaces in some way, because they are the primary way of adding functionality beyond the basic title-link-description combination.  If all you want is title-link-description, stick with your existing RSS 0.91 template and stop reading now.</p>

<p>Still here?  OK.  Now, the <a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss">RSS 2.0 specification</a> says nothing about how to actually use namespaces in RSS, just that you're allowed to.  So where did these particular namespaces come from?  Well, I didn't make them up.  They have been developed over the past two years by some smart people, most of whom hang out on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/">RSS-DEV mailing list</a>.  The namespaces were originally developed for RSS 1.0, and most of them can be used without modification in RSS 2.0.  (There's a lot of stuff I'm skipping over here on purpose.  There will be a lot more documentation forthcoming in the next few months on exactly how to use various namespaces in RSS 2.0.  Some of it still needs to be worked out, but most of it just needs to be written down.  Please be patient.)</p>

<p>So anyway, we use namespaces for a lot of stuff.  Most stuff, in fact.  In the template, you'll see title-link-description for <code>channel</code>, and title-link-description-guid for <code>item</code>.  <code>guid</code> is new in RSS 2.0, and it is used to uniquely identify an item, so even if the title or description changes, aggregators know that it's the same item; the end user can choose whether to re-display changed items, but first programs need to be able to track which items are which.  (<a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> already supports this.)  To create the <code>guid</code>, I've combined <code>MTEntryID</code> with <code>MTBlogURL</code> to generate a unique string for each item, and I've arranged them so there's no confusion about it possibly being a URL.  It's not a URL; it's just a unique string.  (Other systems have stricter format requirements for guids, but RSS 2.0 does not.  A guid is a unique string, and that's all.)</p>

<p>Pretty much everything beyond title-link-description (and guid) uses namespaces.  This template makes use of all 3 of the <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/standard.html">standard RSS 1.0 namespaces</a>, but there are many other <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/proposed.html">proposed namespaces</a> that have a lot of good design behind them.  We use one (<code>admin</code>), which is already widely used; the rest may be useful to you, depending on your niche.  (If you think you need to design your own namespace, look through that list and make sure you're not re-inventing the wheel.)</p>

<p>Back to the template.  Other than guid, the most important thing to note about this template is that the <code>title</code>, <code>link</code>, and <code>description</code> are all plain text.  (<code>description</code> is an excerpt; if you do not enter an excerpt manually for a post, Movable Type will auto-generate one.  You can control how long this auto-generated excerpt is by going to Blog Config, then Preferences, then <q>Number of words in excerpt</q>.)  <code>title</code> was always supposed to be plain text, but sticking to plain text in the <code>description</code> tag is an intentional compromise, to support parsers that can not handle HTML, or handle it improperly.  Never fear, the full HTML text of your post is still included; it's stored in the <code>content:encoded</code> element.  (<a href="http://bitworking.org/Aggie.html">Aggie</a> already supports this.)  This allows more robust news readers -- that can handle either text or HTML -- to offer the end user the choice of whether to see excerpts or full posts.  Some people use news aggregators to find things to read, others like reading everything directly in their aggregator.  RSS 0.9x made you (the author) choose one or the other; RSS 2.0 allows you to offer both, and pass the choice along to the end user.  This is a good thing.</p>

<p>There's more good stuff in there, but the explanations will have to wait for another day.  If you're interested in learning how to extend RSS to suit your needs, your best bet is to read through the documentation of the existing RSS 1.0 namespaces.  If you have questions, your best bet is the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/">RSS-DEV mailing list</a>, where Kevin is currently <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4046">discussing his namespace primer</a>.  Archives are public and free, so no subscription is required, and lurking is encouraged.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><cite>Anil Dash</cite>: <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/003183.php">XML version 1.0</a>.  <q>Why isn't there a way to syndicate my words without butchering the way they look?</q>  Several people protested last week by changing their weblog templates to <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/xmlindex.php">something like this</a>.  <a href="http://q.queso.com/index.php?archives/001000.php">Jason Levine has more links</a> to those involved.  I spoke with one of the people who implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside joke.  Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in general) is to make everyone's words look the same.  Counterpoint: the default in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's forcing you to publish full posts.  This would probably be a good place to insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it.</p>

<p><cite>Timothy Appnel</cite>: <a href="http://www.mplode.com/tima/archives/000107.html">More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF</a>.  FFKAR is <q>the format formerly known as RSS</q>.  <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/840.html">Sam has already implemented it</a>.</p>

<p><cite>Nicholas Avenell</cite>: <a href="http://www.aquarionics.com/nodes/view.php?name=esf">ESF</a>.  <q>Are you also fed up with the continuing war between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn't XML. It isn't RDF. It's just data.</q>  <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam</a> would love it, then.  But <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_tags.html#date tag formats">Movable Type doesn't support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format</a>, which could be an impediment to mainstream acceptance.</p>

<p><cite>Shelley Powers</cite>: <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/000544.php">Consumer Rights and RSS</a>.  <q>I'm not buying into RSS 0.9x. I'm not buying into RSS 2.0. I'm not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:</q></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>RSS not supported here</strong></p>
<p>This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0. If you wish to view entries, may I suggest that you visit the weblog, and save your fast skimming for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>I'm sure this is some sort of DMCA violation or something, but here goes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>import urllib, re; print "&lt;rss&gt;&lt;channel&gt;\n &lt;title&gt;Burningbird&lt;/title&gt;\n &lt;link&gt;http://weblog.burningbird.net/&lt;/link&gt;\n &lt;language&gt;en-us&lt;/language&gt;\n &lt;/channel&gt;\n" + "\n".join(["&lt;item&gt;&lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link&gt;%s&lt;/link&gt;&lt;/item&gt;" % t for t in re.compile(r'dc:title="(.*?)"\s*dc:identifier="(.*?)"', re.DOTALL).findall(urllib.urlopen('http://weblog.burningbird.net/').read())]) + "&lt;/rss&gt;"</code></p>
